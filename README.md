According to the instructions, I was told to create my first portfolio. This portfolio contains a paragraph about myself, along with a recent headshot of myself. Additionally, it contains placeholders for work that I will complete, and ways for potential employers to contact me. In this portfolio, I used both HTML and CSS to build out my portfolio. I made sure that my webpage properly changes sizes for people viewing my site on different sized screens. Next, I made sure that the links in the nav bar took the user to the corresponding part of the webpage. I styled the page in a simple, yet elegent manner that makes the portfolio easy to look at and draws the user to the important material.
